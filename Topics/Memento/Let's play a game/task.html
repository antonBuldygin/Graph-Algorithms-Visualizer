<h2>Let's play a game</h2>
<p>Imagine that your team is making a board game engine. Your teammates already created the <code class="java">Board</code> class and successfully implemented the<code class="java">place</code>, <code class="java">move</code> and <code class="java">reDraw</code> methods of the <code class="java">GameEngine</code> interface in the <code class="java">BoardGameEngine</code> class, but the work is not finished yet: the <code class="java">undo</code>, <code class="java">save</code> and <code class="java">load</code> methods are waiting to be implemented too.</p><p>Since it's a good idea to achieve their functionality using the Memento pattern, your teammates added the <code class="java">Snapshot</code> nested class inside the <code class="java">Board</code> class that will be used for saving and restoring the state of <code class="java">Board</code>. Your task is to finish the work! However, the implementation must satisfy the following requirements:</p><ul><li><p>Do not make breaking changes to the code because <code class="java">BoardGameEngine</code> is already used as an implementation of the <code class="java">GameEngine</code> interface somewhere else. You CAN make changes to the existing code but make sure they won't break anything.</p></li><li><p>The state of <code class="java">Board</code> must be saved automatically every time it changes.</p></li><li><p><code class="java">undo</code> must roll back the changes one by one. If there are no changes left to undo, <code class="java">undo</code> must do nothing.</p></li><li><p><code class="java">save</code> and <code class="java">load</code> must work together: <code class="java">save</code> must create a savepoint <strong>in memory (not on a hard drive!)</strong> and <code class="java">load</code> must restore the board to that state. There must be only one savepoint, and subsequent calls of the <code class="java">save</code> method must overwrite it.</p></li><li><p>If no savepoint is available, the <code class="java">load</code> method must do nothing. Also, when the <code class="java">load</code> method successfully loads a savepoint, the history of <code class="java">Board</code> state changes must be cleared so that <code class="java">undo</code> does not roll back anything until new changes are made.</p></li></ul><p>Good luck and have fun!</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 5 seconds</font><br><br>
